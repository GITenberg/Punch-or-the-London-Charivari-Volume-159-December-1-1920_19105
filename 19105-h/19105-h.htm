<h2>CHARIVARIA.</h2>

<p><span class="sc">According</span> to <i>The Evening News</i>,
lambs have already put in an appearance
in Dorset. People who expect
the <span class="sc">Poet Laureate</span> to rush to the
spot will be bitterly disappointed.</p>

       <hr class="short" />

<p>"What was a golden eagle doing in
Lincolnshire?" asks "L.G.M." in <i>The
Daily Mail</i>. We never answer these
personal questions.</p>

       <hr class="short" />

<p>The Public Libraries Committee of
West Ham has declined to purchase
<i>The Autobiography of Margot Asquith.</i>
It would just serve them right if the
publisher sent them a copy.</p>

       <hr class="short" />

<p>Sir R. <span class="sc">Baden-Powell</span>
recently declared that
men contemplating
matrimony would do
well to notice whether
their prospective brides
gave an inside or an
outside tread. We still
maintain that the safest
course is to remain single
and not be trodden
on either way.</p>

       <hr class="short" />

<p>The report that a
British soldier has recently
discovered a genuine
specimen of a
small war, in which Mr.
<span class="sc">Winston Churchill</span>
had no hand whatever,
is now regarded as untrustworthy.</p>

       <hr class="short" />

<p>A Scotsman knocked
down by a car in New
York was given a glass
of water and quickly
regained consciousness. He is now
making inquiries concerning the number
of times one has to be knocked
down in order to get a drop of spirit.</p>

       <hr class="short" />

<p>Sea-gulls have been observed near the
Willesden public parks. It is assumed
that they didn't know it was Willesden.</p>

       <hr class="short" />

<p>A clothing firm advertises suits to fit
any figure. It is not known what
eventually happened to the man who
asked them to supply him with a suit
for a figure round about thirty shillings.</p>

       <hr class="short" />

<p>An express train recently crashed
through the closed gates of a level-crossing
in Yorkshire. As the driver
did not pull up in order to see what
damage he had done, it is supposed
that he was originally a motorist.</p>

       <hr class="short" />

<p>Another walk from London to Brighton
is being organised. It is hoped that
this habit will ultimately bring down
the high cost of travelling.</p>

       <hr class="short" />

<p>The Hammersmith Council, says a
news item, has placed an order for tiles
in Belgium. Another shrewd stroke
at the Sandringham hat.</p>

       <hr class="short" />

<p>"Trade combinations," declares Sir
<span class="sc">Robert Horne</span>, "are not responsible
for the increased cost of living." We
agree. The struggle for our last shilling
between the dogged-as-does-it
butcher and the grocer who never knows
when he is beaten is <i>à outrance</i>.</p>

       <hr class="short" />

<p>Next year is Census year, and people
are kindly requested to be born early
in order to avoid the rush at the last
moment.</p>

       <hr class="short" />

<p>A new bathing-suit invented by an
official of the Royal Army Clothing
Department is claimed to make drowning
impossible. It is said to fill a long-felt
want among young kittens.</p>

       <hr class="short" />

<p>Should this bathing-suit fail to save
any person from drowning he can call
at the office and have his money back.</p>

       <hr class="short" />

<p>We are asked to deny the rumour
said to be current in Manchester to the
effect that the <span class="sc">Prime Minister</span> was
contemplating publishing a Northern
edition of his New World.</p>

       <hr class="short" />

<p>"To be happy, marry a brown-eyed
girl," says <i>The Daily Graphic</i>. A correspondent
writes to say that he invariably
does.</p>

       <hr class="short" />

<p>"My lodger," said a complainant at
Clerkenwell Police Court, "threatens
to tear me up into pieces." It was
pointed out to him that this would be
a breach of the law.</p>

       <hr class="short" />

<p>During a duel on the cliffs near
Boulogne one of the combatants deliberately
fired his revolver into the sea,
whereupon the other immediately fired
into the air. There seems to be no end
to the dangers which beset submarine-sailors
and airmen.</p>

       <hr class="short" />

<p>A few days ago an angler at Southend-on-Sea
fished up a silver chain purse
containing four one-pound notes. His
claim that a large leather wallet containing
several fivers and a diamond
ring broke the line and
got away after a terrific
struggle is being received
with the usual
caution.</p>

       <hr class="short" />

<p>The many critics of
the <span class="sc">Postmaster-General</span>
should remember
that telephones are all
right if people would
only let them alone.</p>

       <hr class="short" />

<p>Our heart goes out
to the veteran philosopher
who, when caught
climbing apple-trees in
a farmer's orchard,
pleaded that he had
been tampering with a
thyroid gland.</p>

       <hr class="short" />

<p>Five million typhoid
germs, the property of
Mr. <span class="sc">John Gibbon</span>, are
said to be at large in
Philadelphia, according
to <i>The Daily Express</i>. One of them is
said to have got away disguised as a
measle.</p>

       <hr class="short" />

<p>According to <i>The Daily Mail</i> a panic
was recently caused in a Manchester
tea-room by a rat which took refuge in
the leg of a gentleman's trousers. This
may not mean that the need of a new
style of rat-proof trouser has attracted
the interest of Carmelite House publicity
agents, but we have our apprehensions.</p>

       <hr class="short" />

<p>"Hard work will kill no one," declares
a literary editor. Most people,
of course, prefer an occupation with a
spice of danger about it.</p>

<h3>THE STANDARD GOLF-BALL</h3>.

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
  <p>I do not want a standard ball,</p>
    <p class="i2">So many to the pound;</p>
      <p class="i4">Whether its girth is trim and svelte</p>
      <p class="i4">Or built to take an out-size belt,</p>
  <p>I hardly seem to care at all</p>
    <p class="i2">So long as it is round.</p></div>
<div class="stanza">
  <p>But it appears to my poor wit</p>
    <p class="i2">That we might well contrive</p>
      <p class="i4">A means by which the merest babe</p>
      <p class="i4">Would hold his own with <span class="sc">Mitchell</span> (<span class="sc">Abe</span>),</p>
  <p>If we could have a standard <i>hit</i></p>
    <p class="i2">(Especially the drive).</p></div>
<div class="stanza">
  <p>I want a limit made to bar</p>
    <p class="i2">The unrestricted whack</p>
      <p class="i4">(A hundred yards I think should be</p>
      <p class="i4">The length on which we might agree),</p>
  <p>And if you pushed the ball too far</p>
    <p class="i2">You'd have to bring it back.</p></div>
<div class="stanza">
  <p>And I should love a standard <i>lie</i>.</p>
    <p class="i2">A ball inside a cup</p>
      <p class="i4">Or latent under sand or whin</p>
      <p class="i4">Hampers my progress toward the pin;</p>
  <p>It would improve my game if I</p>
    <p class="i2">Could lift and tee it up.</p></div>
<div class="stanza">
  <p>But most, when tongues of golfers wag,</p>
    <p class="i2">Talking their dreadful shop</p>
      <p class="i4">Of rotten luck and stymies laid</p>
      <p class="i4">And chip-approaches, <span class="sc">Taylor</span>-made&mdash;</p>
  <p>Oh, then I want a standard <i>gag</i></p>
    <p class="i2">To make the blighters stop.</p></div>

<h3>THE LANGUAGE FOR LOGIC.</h3>

<p>"Very well," I said, "if Jones is laid up I'll go round
myself."</p>

<p>Our French visitor chuckled quietly and then shrugged
his shoulders by way of apology.</p>

<p>"Pardon," he murmured with the most disarming politeness,
"but your English language it is so veray funny, and
I 'ave not yet become quite used to it. Is it not that it
lack the accuracy, what you call the logic, of the French?"</p>

<p>"Indeed," I said, without the least interest.</p>

<p>But my wife was all enthusiasm. She clapped her hands
in delighted agreement. "M. du Val is quite right, Dickie,"
she said. "We are a frightfully illogical lot, aren't we? I
mean, the French are able to say just exactly what they
mean."</p>

<p>"Your reinforcement, Madame, it completes my victory,"
replied the Frenchman with a graceful gesture. "<i>Voyez,
M'sieu'</i>," he added, turning to me, "you 'ave just said zat
your friend is laid <i>up</i>, when the unfortunate truth is zat
he is laid <i>down</i>, and because of zat you will encircle, surround,
make a tour of your person."</p>

<p>"There, you see," said my wife flatly, "it's all utterly
illogical. Think how logical the French are."</p>

<p>"Well, let us work it out," I said in hearty agreement.
"As a start I solemnly declare that the French are not
so logical as they don't think."</p>

<p>"As they <i>don't</i> think?" repeated my wife in surprise.</p>

<p>"Ah!" I retorted, "you are not so observant as you
might not be. I was merely giving you a little French
idiom, 'logically' and 'accurately done into English.'"</p>

<p>"Mister," I next asked our ally, "your visit to England,
will she be prolonged?"</p>

<p>"Who's the lady?" interrupted my wife.</p>

<p>"M. du Val's visit, of course, dear," I informed her. "You
forget that the French are particularly logical with their
genders."</p>

<p>"M'sieu'!" murmured the guest, rather puzzled.</p>

<p>"I asked," I went on for M. du Val's edification, "because
if you stay long enough you may have the pleasure of
meeting the parents of Mistress my wife. They are coming
to the house of us next month. His father is extremely
anxious to see her daughter, whom he has not seen since
his wedding&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Whom in the world are you talking about?" muttered
my wife.</p>

<p>"Monsieur will readily understand," I said wickedly,
"that I allude to my wife and their parents. I hope they
will bring his brother with them."</p>

<p>"'Her,' you should say," my wife put in with the suspicion
of a snap. "There's only Johnny and me."</p>

<p>"It was of Johnny I spoke," I assured her. "And, by
the way, if you haven't heard the latest gossip it may interest
you to hear that the young rascal has formed an
attachment, and is very proud of her <i>fiancée</i>. She is an
awfully pretty girl and quite athletic as well&mdash;in fact, his
arm is not nearly so small as Johnny's isn't, and his carriage
is perfect. Their eyes are lovely, while a poet would rave
about his sweet nose, her rosebud mouth and their longs
blacks hairs. Their shoes&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, stop!" cried my wife. "You're muddling me all
up. Are you talking about Johnny or&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Name of a pipe, my cabbage," I said, determined to
give her logic with swear-words and endearments as well,
"where has your reasoning gone to? Any logical Frenchman
would tell you at once that I wasn't talking about
Johnny, but about her girl. As I was saying, their shoes
have each a dinky Gibson bow on her."</p>

<p>"M'sieu'," reflected M. du Val in his polite way, "I begin
to think zat you are getting ze advantage over me."</p>

<p>"Don't take any notice of him, Mosseer," pleaded my
wife indignantly; "he's only pulling your leg."</p>

<p>"Pulling my&mdash;?" The Frenchman cogitated for a
minute; then he understood and smiled in a superior way
again. "All the same," he murmured quietly, "we French
'ave not <i>all</i> ze illogicalness, <i>n'est ce pas</i>?"</p>

<p>"Not quite all," I cheerfully agreed. "By the way,
would you like to come with us this afternoon to the great
Review in Hyde Park? Her Majesty the <span class="sc">King</span> will be
there, also the <span class="sc">Queen</span> and very likely His Royal Highness
Princess <span class="sc">Mary</span>&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I come wiz muchness of pleasure," assented our guest
very hurriedly. Then, being a thorough little sportsman,
he added with a bow:&mdash;</p>

<p>"If M'sieu' could persuade <i>'er</i> wife to wear <i>'is</i> new 'at,
so veray charming?"</p>

<h3>UNAUTHENTIC IMPRESSIONS</h3>.

<h4>IV.&mdash;<span class="sc">Dr. Addison</span>.</h4>

<p>The ridiculous tradition of government
by K. C.'s has for some time past
been broken down, and quite a number
of our present Ministers have never
taken silk in their lives, except from
cocoons in a match-box. There is at
least one business man in the Cabinet,
and even the <span class="sc">Lord Chancellor</span>, great
lawyer though he is, is almost equally
renowned as a horseman. "He sits
the Woolsack," a hard-riding Peer has
said of him, "almost as though he were
part of it."</p>

<p>Of this tendency to break away from
the Bar Dr. <span class="sc">Addison</span> is one of the pleasantest
examples. We Englishmen
surely owe as much to our great physicians
as to our great lawyers, and in
some cases indeed the fees are even
higher. After the Demosthenic periods
and Ciceronian verbosity of some of our
previous rulers Dr. <span class="sc">Addison's</span> bright
bedside manner with an ailing or moribund
Bill is a refreshing spectacle. The
shrewd face under the shock of white
hair is too well known to need description.
The small black bag and the slight
bulge in the top-hat, caused by the
stethoscope, are equally familiar. Nor
is there wanting in Dr. <span class="sc">Addison</span> that
touch of firmness which is so necessary
to a good practitioner and in his case
comes partly, no doubt, from his Lincolnshire
origin, for he was born in the
county which has already produced such
men as Sir <span class="sc">Isaac Newton</span>, the late
Lord <span class="sc">Tennyson</span>, M. <span class="sc">Worth</span> of Paris,
the present Governor of South Australia
and <span class="sc">Hereward the Wake</span>.</p>

<p>None but the robustest of officials is
allowed to direct the affairs of the new
Ministry of Health. The patron saint
of its Chief is St. Pancreas and his eupepsia
is reflected in his subordinates.
His junior clerks whistle continuously,
his liftmen yodel, his typists sing. Of his
own official methods I have been privileged
to obtain the report of an eye-witness.
Let us suppose that, as frequently
happens, a deputation of disappointed
house-hunters has arrived to see him.</p>

<p><i>Leader of Deputation.</i> We want houses
and we won't wait.</p>

<p><i>Dr. Addison (tapping his forehead and
glancing significantly at his Private Secretary).</i>
Tck, tck! That's very serious.
Shall we feel the pulse?</p>

<p class="author">
[<i>Leader of Deputation puts his hand<br />
out. Private Secretary takes out<br />
his watch. Sixty seconds elapse.</i>
</p>

<p><i>Dr. Addison.</i> Do you take much
walking exercise?</p>

<p><i>Leader of Deputation.</i> No.</p>

<p><i>Dr. Addison.</i> Ah, I thought as much.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"After breakfast walk a mile,</p>
<p>After dinner rest awhile."</p>
  </div>
  </div>

<p>What you need is a good sound constitutional
every morning. If you <i>see</i> any
houses, of course there is no objection
to your <i>looking</i> at them. But keep on
walking, mind; don't loiter. And come
back to me in a month's time and we'll
see how you are then.</p>

<p class="author">
[<i>Exit Deputation, looking slightly
dazed.</i>
</p>

<p>Almost equally successful is Dr. <span class="sc">Addison's</span>
professional method in dealing
with representatives of the Building
Trades Unions. A bricklayers' leader,
let us say, has expounded at great length
the technical difficulties which prevent
rapidity of construction.</p>

<p><i>Dr. Addison</i> (<i>softly and suddenly</i>).
Take a deep breath. (<i>Bricklayer takes</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page425" id="page425"></a>[pg 425]</span>
<i>it.</i>) Say ninety-nine! (<i>Bricklayer tries
hard.</i>) Where do you feel the pain?</p>

<p><i>Bricklayer.</i> In the shoulders and
arms.</p>

<p><i>Dr. Addison.</i> Tck, tck, we must go
easy. Don't take it too quickly, and
we'll have you right again before the
year's out. Try three bricks a day and
come and see me in a month's time.</p>

<p>These, however, are not the only
methods by which Dr. <span class="sc">Addison</span> has
attempted to remedy the crisis. At his
suggestion a permanent sub-committee
of the Cabinet, called "The Happy
Homes for Heroes' Panel," was appointed,
and it was during one of its
sessions that the bright idea of Housing
Bonds was originated, I believe by
Sir <span class="sc">Alfred Mond</span>. If the campaign
has not met with the success which it
deserves, the cause is probably to be
found in the slightly unfortunate title
whose assonance suggests to the public
mind the "House of Bondage" in the
Psalms. It would have been better, I
think, to adopt Mr. <span class="sc">Austen Chamberlain's</span>
suggestion, which was "The
Cosy Cot Combine."</p>

<p>However, things are not as bad as
they might seem, and outside one large
suburb the other day I observed a gang
of bricklayers actually in operation,
anxiously hovered over by a clerk from
the Ministry, thermometer in hand.</p>

<p>I think I have forgotten to mention in
this brief sketch that Dr. <span class="sc">Addison</span> has
a frame of iron. Since I have said it
of all the other Cabinet Ministers of
whom I have spoken, I ought certainly
to say it of Dr. <span class="sc">Addison</span> too. Like
Mr. <span class="sc">Lloyd George</span>, like Mr. <span class="sc">Winston
Churchill</span>, like Sir <span class="sc">Eric Geddes</span>, the
<span class="sc">Minister of Health and Housing</span> has
a frame of iron. All that he really
needs is the concrete.</p>

<h3>RACING AS A BUSINESS.</h3>

<p class="note">[The kind of article which one may confidently
look for in the sporting columns of a
penny newspaper at this time of the year.]</p>

<p>From the very beginning of the season
I have insisted that our objective should
be "the winter's keep." Those who
have stuck to me all along and played
my system are on velvet.</p>

<p>During the flat-racing year I have
given a hundred-and-fourteen selections.
Let me just tabulate the results; I like
tabulating, for it fills my column in no
time.</p>

<table align="center" summary="list" border="0">

       <td>Selections.</td>
       <td>Won.</td>

<p class="center">
N.B.&mdash;Non-starters neglected.</p>


<p>The above is a statement of which I
may well be proud. I assert with confidence
that few sporting journalists
can show anything like this record.</p>

<p>Certain captious correspondents like
"O. T." and "Disgusted" have pointed
out that my selections during this
period show a loss of £104 9<i>s.</i> 11&frac12;<i>d.</i> on
a <i>flat stake</i> of £1. All I can say is
that people who bet increasing stakes
are increasing, while people who bet
flat stakes are&mdash;&mdash; Well, that disposes
of "Disgusted" and "O. T." My
readers know that my system is to
have the minimum stake on the losers
and the maximum stake on the winners.
We shall never attain that abstract perfection,
but we should keep this ideal
before us. I believe in idealism; it pays.</p>

<p>Take yesterday's selections, for instance.
Here they are, with results
tabulated:&mdash;</p>

<p>That I consider a highly successful
day's racing, provided your stakes were
proportionally placed; and here again
I must insist on my principle of maximum
and minimum stakes.</p>

<p>Let us suppose, as naturally most of
my readers did, that a backer went to
the course with a bookmaker's credit
of twenty thousand pounds and a thousand
or so spare cash in his pocket.
Being a shrewd man he would place £1
on Breathing Time to win. (I daresay
even "O. T." and "Disgusted" did me
the honour of following me so far.) On
Taddenham, true to my principles, our
backer would raise his stake to £1 10<i>s.</i>
Aminta I. would carry £2, or £2 10<i>s.</i>
if he were punting. But I cannot too
strongly discourage this habit of making
violent increases in stake; it is almost
gambling. Much better put on only
£2 with a safe bookmaker, such as Mr.
Bob Mowbray, of Conduit Street, whose
advertisement appears elsewhere in our
columns.</p>

<p>To proceed, our backer finds to his
relief that Giddy Gertie is a non-starter
and retires to the refreshment bar for
a bracer. The 2.30 race being run off
he returns to the Ring for the serious
business of the day. After examining
Transformation in the paddock and listening
to the comments of the knowing
ones&mdash;"Too thick in the barrel," "Too
long in the pastern," "Too moth-eaten
in the coat"&mdash;he will exercise caution
and, instead of "putting his shirt" on
Transformation and plunging to the
extent of, say, £5, will put up not more
than £3 10<i>s.</i> and await the result with
calmness. When Transformation is returned
unplaced (or, as "O. T." and
"Disgusted" would say, "also ran")
our backer is not abashed. Taking full
advantage of his credit he places his
twenty thousand on Likely Case, together
perhaps with the odd thousand
or so in his pocket, being careful, however,
to ascertain that his return ticket
is still safely in his possession.</p>

<p>Our backer is shrewd enough to understand
that this is a case for the maximum
stake. Strong in his faith in my principle
he sees Likely Case win with little
surprise.</p>

<p>Returning to Town that evening he records
his day's dealings in this manner:</p>

<p>I may mention that the official s.p.
of 20 to 1 on Likely Case is distinctly
cramped. On the course it was possible
to obtain more generous terms and lay
only 19 to 1 on.</p>

<p>Thus one sportsman by careful observance
of my principle has stacked
up a goodly array of chips towards his
winter's keep. All this goes to show
that if a man will bet sanely and avoid
"going for the gloves" he can make a
modest competence on the Turf.</p>

<p>In Nurseries, Weight-for-age races
and so on I make it a rule to give only
one selection, but in a struggle of this
importance I expect to receive a little
more latitude. Of these, then, I take
Mayana and Periwig to beat the field.
At the same time I feel strongly that
Wise Uncle's form at Kempton was not
correct, and that he will nearly win, if
he can beat Beatus, who seems to be
let in nicely at 7 st. All the above will
be triers, but it is doubtful whether any
amount of trying will enable them to
beat Avignon, whose chances I am content
to support. I conclude by wishing
my readers a good time over this race.</p>

<h3>THE PLACE OF THE TROMBONE IN THE BAND.</h3>

<p>When I speak of the place of the
trombone in the band I am not referring
to his site or locality. That is for the
conductor to settle. My purpose is to
give an intelligent reply to the oft-quoted
query, "Why the trombone?"</p>

<p>Everybody knows that it is not in the
band for musical purposes. It is not a
musical instrument. The man who could
extract music from a trombone could get
grapes out of a coal-mine.</p>

<p>No, its <i>raison d'être</i> is mostly critical
and punitive. It is there to see that
the orchestra does its job and to put the
fear of a hectic hereafter into the man
who is out of step with his fellow-conspirators.</p>

<p>The uninformed
have a vague idea that
the conductor should
do that with his little
stick. But I put it to
you, what use would a
little stick be against a
man like the big drum?
A meat-axe would
have some point, but
the difficulties of conducting
with a meat-axe
will be obvious to
even the least musical.</p>

<p>When the French
horn, in the throes of
a liver attack, sees supplementary
spots on
the score and plays
them with abandon,
or when the clarionet
(or clarinet), having
inadvertently sucked
down a fly which in
an adventurous mood
has strolled into one of those little holes
in the instrument, coughs himself half
out of his evening clothes, does the conductor
forsake his air of austerity and
use language unbefitting a solemn occasion?
Does he pick up his music-stand
and hurl it at the offender? He does
not. It would be a breach of etiquette.</p>

<p>He simply signals to the trombone,
who promptly turns the exit part of his
instrument on the culprit and gives a
bray that makes the unfortunate man's
shirt-front crumple up like a concertina.
That is discipline.</p>

<p>Then again the trombone is employed
as a sort of brake when in a moment
of excitement the rest of the orchestra
has a tendency to overdo things.</p>

<p>For example, all will remember the
throbbing moment at the end of the
drama, where the hero and heroine,
murmuring "At last!" fall into each
other's arms and move slowly off the
stage whilst the band starts up <span class="sc">Mendelssohn's</span>
or <span class="sc">Glückstein's</span> "Wedding
March." The effect on an orchestra is
immediate and immense. Somewhere
behind each of these stiff shirt-fronts
beats a heart that thrills at every suggestion
of romance. It is well known
that, when at intervals during a performance
they retire through the man-hole
under the stage, it is to imbibe
another chapter of <span class="sc">Ethel M. Dell</span> or
of "Harried Hannah, the Bloomsbury
Bride." And so the lingering embrace
of the lovers sets them tingling and
they tackle the "Wedding March" at
the double. The clarionet (or clarinet)
wipes the tears from his eyes and puts
a sob in his rendering; the cornet unswallows
his mouthpiece and, getting
his under-jaw well jutted out, decides
to put a jerk in it; the piccolo pickles
with furious enthusiasm; the 'cello puts
his instrument in top-gear with his left
hand and saws away violently with the
other; the triangle, who has fallen
perhaps into a Euclidian dream, sits
up and gets a move on; the stevedore&mdash;no,
no, that is the next chapter&mdash;the
oboe, the French horn, the kettledrum,
the euphonium, the proscenium, the
timbrel, the hautboy, the sackbut-and-ashes&mdash;all
get a grip of the ground
with both feet and let her go.</p>

<p>They try to depict golden lands of
radiant sunshine, where beautiful
couples stroll hand-in-hand for ever
and the voice of the turtle replaces
that of the raucous vendor of the racing
edition.</p>

<p>If they were allowed to have their
way the effect on the unmarried portion
of the audience would be to send them
rushing out of the theatres and dragging
registrars out of a sick-bed in order to
perform the marriage ceremony there
and then.</p>

<p>But the trombone introduces the
hard practical note, the necessary corrective.
His monotonous grunt is used
to remind the audience of marriage as
it is lived in real life, of the girl at
breakfast in unmarcelled hair, of the
man dropping cigarette-ash on the best
carpet, of double income-tax, of her
family, of his, of her bills for frocks, of
his wandering off to golf or the club,
and a host of other incidentals.</p>

<p>A reaction takes place among the
audience. Men who had been a moment
before estimating the price of a diamond-ring
turn their thoughts to two-stroke
motor-bicycles, and girls decide that
love in a cottage is an overrated pastime&mdash;especially
when
you can't get the cottage&mdash;and
decide to
wait a few years till a
house or two has been
built.</p>

<p>That is the chief
function of the trombone&mdash;to
pursue those
who are wandering in
the clouds and bring
them to earth with a
crash.</p>

<h3>MY WEATHER-GUIDE.</h3>

<p>I was admiring Cripstock's barometer.</p>

<p>"Take it," he said.</p>

<p>"My dear Cripstock!" I exclaimed,
as I pulled it from the wall.</p>

<p>"My dear fellow!" he replied, in tones
more of gratitude than of generosity.</p>

<p>I have fastened it in my hall at the
regulation distance from the hat-rack
and between the assegais. It will be
nice company for the dinner-gong,
which it faces. I purposely did not
place them side by side, for fear of any
error in tapping.</p>

<p>These delicate contrivances do not
readily settle down in a new home, and
for a week I ignored the barometer.
This may have seemed unfriendly to a
newcomer, yet surely it was kind not
to observe any faults it might display
during its novitiate. When on the Saturday
morning I scrutinised it for the first
time I saw it pointed to "Stormy." I
hastened over breakfast in order to get
into the garden in time to fix up the
starboard fence. After working feverishly
for three hours, glancing at the
sky at frequent intervals, I heard the
"All clear" signalled from a back
window, the needle having swung round
to "Set Fair."</p>

<p>There it remained for several days, a
marvel of accuracy. My poor umbrella
began to wear a look of neglect, but
my walking-stick was jubilant. "Set
Fair" it was again on the Friday, and
again I set out with my happy malacca.</p>

<p>On my return wet through I had
another proof of the excellence of my
faithful aneroid. Its needle pointed
imperatively to "Change." This, in
fact, I had already decided to do, but to
a less careful man the instruction must
have been of inestimable advantage.</p>

<h3>THE BROWN LADY.</h3>


<p>We were talking of the sex, the dark
and the fair, and "Give me," he said,
"a brunette every time. But how
seldom one meets them now!"</p>

<p>I expressed surprise at this.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, "it is so. Plenty of
women with dark hair, but not dark
skins. The true brunette is very rare."</p>

<p>"I know one," I said; "probably the
most perfect brunette in London."</p>

<p>"Young?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes," I said.</p>

<p>"Could I&mdash;would you take me to
see her?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Certainly," I said.</p>

<p>"When?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Now," I said; "this afternoon. But
we must hurry. Her servants have
orders not to let anyone in after four."</p>

<p>"You're sure she won't mind?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"Absolutely," I said. "My friends
are hers. I've introduced lots of people
to her and she's delighted."</p>

<p>He smiled blissfully.</p>

<p>Having obtained a taxi I gave an
address in Regent's Park, but told the
driver to stop at a shop on the way
"She loves sweets," I explained.</p>

<p>"They all do," he replied, with the
sententiousness of gallantry, as though
speaking from abysmal depths of knowledge.</p>

<p>"Yes, but she has a more catholic
taste than most," I said. "She's the
only brunette&mdash;or, if it comes to that,
the only blonde&mdash;I ever knew with a
weakness for&mdash;well, I'll make you
guess."</p>

<p>"Preserved ginger?" he suggested.</p>

<p>"No," I said.</p>

<p>"American pop-corn?"</p>

<p>"Not that I know," I said.</p>

<p>"Tell me," he replied.</p>

<p>"Condensed milk," I said.</p>

<p>"Good Heavens!" he exclaimed.
"Condensed milk? That's the oddest
thing I've ever heard."</p>

<p>"That's what I'm getting," I said;
"and it won't injure your chances with
her if you take her a pot of honey."</p>

<p>"But I don't know her," he submitted.</p>

<p>"It doesn't matter," I said; "she's
the most unconventional creature in the
world&mdash;just a child of nature."</p>

<p>"Delicious!" he murmured.</p>

<p>"She's a Canadian, you see," I added.</p>

<p>"Oh, a Canadian," he replied, as
though that explained everything. "And,
by the way, what's her name?"</p>

<p>"She lets me call her Winnie," I said.</p>

<p>"And what do I call her?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Well," I said, "if I were you I'd
call her Winnie too. She'd love it."</p>

<p>"This is extraordinarily interesting,"
he replied. "But you know I'm far
too shy to do a thing like that."</p>

<p>When, however, the time came and
we were shown into Winnie's drawing-room
in Mappin Terrace and the most
adorable brown bear in captivity came
lumbering towards us, he called her
Winnie as naturally as her keeper does
or any of the Canadian soldiers whose
mascot she was, and he held the honey-pot
for her until her tongue had extracted
every drop. She then clawed
at his pocket for more.</p>

<p>"I told you she'd like you," I said.</p>

<p>"Isn't she a pet? And a brunette
all right? I didn't deceive you."</p>

<p>"She's perfect," he said. "Absolutely
<i>the</i> Queen of She-Bears."</p>

<p>And so say all good Zoologicians.</p>

<h3>ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT</h3>.

<p><i>Monday, November 22nd.</i>&mdash;Fortunately
or unfortunately, according to
one's point of view, this deponent was
not a spectator of the fight in the
House of Commons this afternoon,
having been himself previously knocked
out by a catarrhal microbe possessing,
as the sporting journals say, "a remarkable
punch." He therefore gives the
fracas an honourable miss.</p>

<p>The Tariff Reformers were horrified
to hear from Sir <span class="sc">Robert Horne</span> that
nearly four hundred thousand pounds'
worth of clocks had been imported from
Germany this year. They were quite
under the impression that when we
wound up the Watch on the Rhine
clocks were included.</p>

<p>They were still more surprised to
learn that without further legislation
it is impossible for British parents,
when purchasing toys for their children,
to be sure that they are not the productions
of our late enemies. It would
appear that the famous label, "Made in
Germany," which did so much to advertise
the products of the Fatherland
before the War, has now outlived its
usefulness; but the goods are coming
along just the same.</p>

<h4>A LECTURE TO THE UPPER SCHOOL.</h4>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Lord Birkenhead</span>.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Tuesday, November 23rd.</i>&mdash;Lord <span class="sc">Birkenhead's</span>
complete recovery from his
recent ear-trouble was attested by the
ease and mastery of his speech in moving
the Second Reading of the Government
of Ireland Bill. Some men in this situation
might have been a little embarrassed
by their past. But Sir <span class="sc">Edward
Carson's</span> erstwhile "galloper" neither
forgot nor apologised for his daring
feats of horsemanship, and triumphantly
produced a letter from his former
chief assuring "my dear Lord Chancellor"
that "Ulster" had come round
to the view that "the best and only
solution of the question is to accept
the present Bill and to endeavour to
work it loyally."</p>

<p>For the rest he minimised the temporary
partition of Ireland and laid stress
on the ultimate union to be effected by
the Council of Ireland; magnified the
financial advantages&mdash;seven millions is
the sum he reckons Southern Ireland
will ultimately have to play with&mdash;and
hinted that they might be further
stretched "if peace were offered to us
by any body which was qualified to
speak for Irish opinion."</p>

<p>For a time little encouragement came
from the Irish Peers. Lord <span class="sc">Dunraven</span>
moved the rejection of the Bill, on the
ground that there could never be permanent
peace in Ireland until moderate
opinion was behind the law, and that
moderate opinion would not be satisfied
without full financial control. Lord
<span class="sc">Willoughby de Broke</span> spoke as an
unrepentant Unionist, and Lord <span class="sc">Clanwilliam</span>
bluntly declared that the Irish
were one of those peoples who were
unfit to govern themselves and who
had got to be governed.</p>

</div>

<p>The Duke of <span class="sc">Abercorn</span>, as an Ulsterman,
supported the Bill, and Lord <span class="sc">Haldane</span>
gave an elegant exhibition of the
military exercise known as "the balance
step without advancing." It was not
the Bill he would have drafted, and the
Government must pass it on their own
responsibility. Still he thought it
should be given a chance.</p>

<p>In the Commons Sir <span class="sc">Archibald
Williamson</span> gave an account of the remarkable
transmigrations of the Egyptian
G.H.Q., which within a few weeks
was located at the Savoy Hotel, the
Abbassiah Barracks and the Eden Hotel.
"Each move was made from motives
of economy." Sir <span class="sc">Alfred Mond</span> is
understood to be most anxious to know
how this game is played. He can
manage the first moves all right, but
never achieves a winning position.</p>

<p><i>Wednesday, November 24th.</i>&mdash;Those
who were fortunate enough to hear
Viscount <span class="sc">Grey's</span> speech on the Government
of Ireland Bill speak of it as on
a par with that which he delivered
as the spokesman of the nation on
August 3rd, 1914. To me it did not
appear quite so plain and coherent; but
who can be plain and coherent about
the Irish Question? Lord <span class="sc">Grey</span> thinks,
for example, that if the Government
made a more liberal offer to Nationalist
Ireland the pressure of moderate opinion
would put an end to murders and outrages.
But how would that moderate
opinion be able to overcome the terrorism
of the secret societies, which, as
Lord <span class="sc">Bryce</span> told the Peers, have dogged
every Irish patriotic movement since
the eighteenth century and which will
admit no compromise with the hated
invader?</p>

<p>The debate was neatly summarised
by Lord <span class="sc">Ribblesdale</span>, who said, "We
are all Home Rulers, but each of us
thinks the other fellow's brand is
wrong."</p>

<p>The state of Ireland was at that
moment being debated in the Commons,
when Mr. <span class="sc">Asquith</span> found himself saddled
with the introduction of a motion
which, while nominally blaming the
Irish Executive, really accused the soldiers
and police of attacking the lives
and property of innocent people. The
awkwardness of the situation was reflected
in the terms of his indictment.
At one moment the charge was that
houses and creameries were destroyed
"without discrimination" between innocent
and guilty; at the next the
House was asked to note "overwhelming
evidence of organisation." His
only suggestion for a remedy was that
we should get into touch with "the
real opinion of the great bulk of the
Irish people," but he did not indicate
how it was to be done or what the
opinion would be when you got to it.</p>

<p>Sir <span class="sc">Hamar Greenwood</span> is quite clear
that you won't get to it until you have
crushed the murder-gang which is terrorising
the great mass of the Southern
Irish people, not excluding "the intellectual
leaders of Sinn Fein."</p>

<p>Colonel <span class="sc">John Ward</span> cleverly remodelled
the resolution into a vote of
thanks to the servants of the Crown in
Ireland for their courage and devotion,
and this was eventually adopted by 303
votes to 83.</p>

<p><i>Thursday, November 25th.</i>&mdash;For the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page434" id="page434"></a>[pg 434]</span>
first time in its history the House of
Lords gave a Second Reading to a
Home Rule Bill for Ireland. Up to
the very last the issue was in doubt,
for Lord <span class="sc">Midleton's</span> motion that the
debate should be adjourned for a fortnight,
in order that a more generous
financial scheme might be produced,
attracted two classes of Peers&mdash;those
who are resigned to Home Rule, but
want a better brand, and those who
won't have it at any price or in any
shape.</p>

<p><i>Lord Curzon.</i> "Lord <span class="sc">Willoughby de Broke</span>
still remained a magnificent relic of the Old
Guard."</p>
</div>

<p>On the steps of the Throne sat the
<span class="sc">Prime Minister</span>, whose humility in
going no higher will doubtless receive
favourable comment in Welsh pulpits.
He was accompanied&mdash;I will not say
shepherded&mdash;by Sir <span class="sc">Hamar Greenwood</span>
and Sir <span class="sc">Edward Carson</span>. What signals,
if any, passed between this triumvirate
and the Woolsack I cannot say, but
the fact remains that, after a brief chat
with the <span class="sc">Lord Chancellor</span>, Lord
<span class="sc">Curzon</span> came down heavily against the
motion. An adjournment would be
useless unless it produced peace. But
could Lord <span class="sc">Midleton</span> guarantee that
even the most complete fiscal autonomy
would satisfy Sinn Fein? If later on,
when the Irish Parliaments were in
operation, a demand came from a united
Ireland, the Government would give it
friendly consideration. Lord <span class="sc">Midleton's</span>
motion having been rejected by
eighty-six votes, and Lord <span class="sc">Dunraven's</span>
by ninety, the Second Reading was
agreed to without a division.</p>

<p>In the Commons a final attempt to
defeat the Agricultural Bill was made
by the Farmers' Party. Mr. <span class="sc">Courthope</span>
declared that the Bill would
produce only doubt and uncertainty,
whereas the farmer needed confidence,
a plant of slow growth (as we know on
the authority of another statesman),
which would not flourish under bureaucratic
supervision. Sir F. <span class="sc">Banbury</span>
said the measure must end in nationalisation,
and he would prefer nationalisation&mdash;<i>cum</i>
proper compensation, of
course&mdash;straight away. The surprising
statement by a Labour Member, that
the farmers had subsidised the nation
to the extent of forty millions a year
by selling at less than world-prices,
may have helped to placate their
champions, who had not quite realised
what generous fellows they were, for
only a dozen stalwarts carried their
protest into the Division Lobby.</p>

<h3>IMPROVING "HANSARD."</h3>

<p>If <i>Hansard</i> would only introduce a
little brightness into its bald and unconvincing
narrative of Parliamentary
procedure it would provide reading-matter
which would grip the heart and
stir the emotions, winning many new
readers from the students of fiction and
other light literature. <i>Hansard</i> will
otherwise never find it worth while to
organise sand-castle competitions for
the little ones about its certified net
sales.</p>

<p>It suffers under the disadvantage of
having no sporting expert, no front-rank
descriptive writer and no specialist
in the humanities (sometimes known as
a sob-artist) on its staff. That is why
it reports a soul-stirring incident in the
following terms?&mdash;</p>

<p>"Mr. X. struck out, and unintentionally
hit an hon. member (Mr. Y.),
who was sitting in close proximity.
Grave disorder having thus arisen, Mr.
Speaker rose and ordered the suspension
of the sitting under Standing Order
No. 21."</p>

<p>How differently the thing might have
been done if put into competent hands.
Would not something like the following
(though far short of perfection, we
admit) have been more acceptable to
the general reader?&mdash;</p>

<p>Mr. X's erstwhile florid face paled.
An ugly look invaded his features of
normally classic beauty. Flinging off
his braided morning-coat he flew
at his opponent. Parrying with his
right he brought his left well home
with a middle-and-off jab, tapping the
claret&mdash;a pretty blow, whose only defect
was that it struck the wrong face.</p>

<p>Other honourable Members hastened
to join the <i>mêlée</i>. Pince-nez flew in
every direction, toupées were disarranged,
dental plates shook to their
very foundations. The opposition pack
worked well, displaying brilliant footwork,
tackling low and dodging neatly
the dangerous cross-kicks of their
opponents. The heel-work, while above
the average, was too often below the
belt.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the only lady Member
present sat pale and bright-eyed, a silent
spectator. Her mind, working rapidly,
sensed an impending catastrophe. What
could she do to emphasise the woman's
point of view? At the sight of blood
she nerved herself with a supreme
effort to remain in her place. Then,
springing to action, she tore her dainty
handkerchief into strips with which to
provide the bandages which it seemed
would inevitably be needed.</p>

<p>At last silence reigned. The collar-studs
were collected from the floor of
the House and the few remaining
Members breathlessly awaited the resumption
of the sitting.</p>

<p>As the hon. Member apologised every
throat was dry, but most of the eyes
were moist. The gracious acceptance of
the apology moved strong men to weep
aloud until called to order. And there,
in the background, sat she whose
woman's wit had shown the better way.</p>

<h3>"G.B.R.L."</h3>


<p>G.B.R.L.'s are an old-established
convention in my family. Joan and
Pauline ("Porgie" <i>libentius audit</i>) are
exceptional authorities on the animal
world in general; exceptional, at any
rate, for their years, which respectively
total four-spot-six and two-spot-five.
They confound their parents daily with
questions relating to the habits of marmots
or the language of kiwis. But
they never talk about "lions," <i>tout
court</i>. A lion is, <i>ex-officio</i> and <i>ipso facto</i>,
a Great-Big-Roarin'-Lion&mdash;always has
been: in short, a G.B.R.L.</p>

<p>It reminds me of a man I know who
was made a G.B.E.; but that's another
story, and Joan wouldn't see the joke
of it anyhow, though I know she would
smile politely.</p>

<p>But in this matter of lions, from which
I am tending to digress, the old G.B.R.
convention has just been weighed in the
balance and found wanting. It came
about in this wise. Joan's and Porgie's
Uncle Barney (his nose is <i>retroussé</i>, if
anything, only he had the misfortune
to be born on St. Barnabas' Day) departed
the other day for Afric's sunny
shores&mdash;for Algiers, in fact&mdash;to nurse a
tedious trench legacy. This, of course,
was a matter of great concern to his
nieces, in whose eyes he is distinctly
<i>persona grata</i>, owing to his command
of persiflage and taste in confectionery.</p>

<p>I went into the nursery on the fateful
morning to break the sad news. My
daughters were at breakfast and I was
just in time to hear Joan's grace, "Thank
God for our b'ekfas'&mdash;and <i>do</i> make us
good." The extremely sanctimonious
tone in which this was delivered, combined
with the melodramatic scowl
which marred the usual serenity of
Porgie's countenance, convinced me
that the morning had commenced inauspiciously
and that it would be well
to gild the pill which I had to administer.</p>

<p>"Hallo, stout women," I said cheerfully.
Joan looked politely bored but
made no reply.</p>

<p>"Not 'tout wimmin," said Porgie
heavily and uncompromisingly. Obviously
it was too early in the day for
any of that sparkling back-chat for
which my daughters are so justly
famed. So I got down to hard tacks
at once.</p>

<p>"Your Uncle Barney," I said, "is
going to Algiers to-day."</p>

<p>I explained that Algiers was in Africa,
where the black men come from. Joan
was mildly intrigued. She opined that
her Uncle Barney would follow the
local customs (as she understood them)
and wear no clothes. I said I doubted
if his medical adviser would approve of
his carrying international courtesy to
such an extreme. Joan was frankly disappointed.
So I tried again.</p>

<p>"I expect he'll see some lions in
Africa," I suggested.</p>

<p>Joan's interest revived. "Great-big-roarin'-lions,"
she corrected me. Porgie
expressed herself, as usual, in precisely
similar terms.</p>

<p>"Yes," I said feelingly, "great big
roarers. I expect they'll eat him up
quite soon."</p>

<p>Joan looked deeply concerned at this
callous prediction, and the corners of
Porgie's mouth drooped ominously.</p>

<p>"I don't like roarin' lions," said Joan.</p>

<p>"Don't nike roarin' nions," said
Porgie.</p>

<p>"Are they in cages?" suggested Joan
hopefully. This was an excellent idea.</p>

<p>"Of course they are," I said with
great heartiness.</p>

<p>Joan was not satisfied. "Will they
roar when they see Uncle Barney?"
she inquired.</p>

<p>This gave me my chance most unexpectedly.
"I should just think they
will," I said. "If they see him dressed
like your black men, they'll roar till
the tears pour down their cheeks."</p>

<p>"I 'spect they'd be laughing at him,"
said Joan, gracefully helping me out.</p>

<p>"I 'spect so," I replied.</p>

<p>"<i>I</i> see," said Joan comfortably.</p>

<p>"<i>I</i> see," said Porgie.</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>So G.B.R.L. has come to have a new
and a more genial significance, thanks
to Uncle Barney.</p>

<h3>ONE TOUCH OF DICKENS.</h3>


<p>Knowing that there was everything
in my appearance to command respect,
I went into the manager's room with
confidence. Lean and brown and middle-aged,
in a tweed coat and grey flannel
trousers, which, though not new, were
well cut, I felt that I looked like one
accustomed to put in and take out sums
from banks. There was no trying for
effect, no effort, no tie-pin. The stick
I carried was a plain ash. The pipe,
which I removed from my mouth, had
no silver mounting. Ah, but it showed
the tiny mother-of-pearl star which
stamped it as a Bungknoll. There was
going to be no difficulty here.</p>

<p>"Good morning," I said. "I regret
to trouble a busy man over a small
matter, but I wish to cash a cheque
for ten pounds."</p>

<p>He was a quiet, capable-looking man
with a rather tired expression.</p>

<p>"The cashing of cheques," he said,
laying down his pipe, "is one item of
our duties."</p>

<p>"Unfortunately," I continued, "I
have run short of money. I bought a
rather good print in a shop down the
road and it has left me without any. I
can give a cheque on Bilson's, but the
banks in town close to-morrow and it
would mean waiting three days, so I
hope that you will be able to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You can bring someone to identify
you, of course?" he said, reaching for
a bell.</p>

<p>"I am sorry to say that I am unknown
here. I am all right at the hotel,
but I don't like to ask the people for
money. I have brought only a small
bag, and what with the races and so
forth I might expose myself to a disagreeable
refusal."</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, "you might. But
I'm afraid I can't cash a cheque for
you without an identification. I'll send
it for collection if you like."</p>

<p>"But that means waiting for days,
and I haven't a shilling left. I came
here for a week to look at the country
about your town&mdash;a beautiful little
town." I added this diplomatically.</p>

<p>"Do you think so? I consider it a
hole. But I don't know much about it
as I'm only here for a week. However,
I'm sorry I can't help you except in
the way I mentioned."</p>

<p>"But look here&mdash;do I look like the
kind of man who plays tricks? Here
is my card and my club address. And
letters"&mdash;I tore one out of an envelope,
but it was the one from Mosbyson's
reminding me that they had already
applied twice for payment&mdash;"but letters
are of little use to identify one."</p>

<p>"They are," he agreed.</p>

<p>"The fact is, among other things, I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page437" id="page437"></a>[pg 437]</span>
want to buy another print which I
have just caught sight of. It may be
snapped up at any moment, like the
one I snapped up yesterday."</p>

<p>"Let it go. It's probably a fake."</p>

<p>"Which one?" I said hotly. "The
one I bought yesterday or the one I'm
going to buy?"</p>

<p>"Both. But I can't cash your cheque."</p>

<p>"But look at the mess I'll be in.
Would you have me pawn my watch?"</p>

<p>"I would not; neither would I have
you not do so, if you take my meaning."</p>

<p>"I see," I said bitterly. "In plain
words you are indifferent to my fate."</p>

<p>He smiled slightly and reached for a
match to re-light his pipe.</p>

<p>My blood was up. I would not be
defied by this man; at least, not completely.
"Very well," I said coldly, "I
will leave my cheque for ten pounds
with you and take only a couple on
account."</p>

<p>"I couldn't do that either."</p>

<p>"Well, a pound will have to do then."</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Then," I said in despair, "we come
to the ridiculously small amount of
eighteenpence. Ha, ha!"</p>

<p>"And that," he answered, "would
be equally objectionable."</p>

<p>I started. "Come," I said, "you are
human after all. You can quote at
random from <span class="sc">Dickens</span>. You read him?"</p>

<p>"I do. When not engaged in business
pursuits." He looked anxiously
at the clock.</p>

<p>"Who was <i>Mrs. Chickenstalker</i>?" I
asked sternly.</p>

<p>"She kept a shop. In <i>The Haunted
Man</i>."</p>

<p>"Whom did <i>Mr. Wopsle</i> marry?"</p>

<p>"Nobody. But hadn't you better see
about your watch?"</p>

<p>"Not yet. How many glasses of
punch did <i>Mr. Pickwick</i> drink on One
Tree Hill?"</p>

<p>"Depends on how you count them.
I make it eight."</p>

<p>"Correct. Look here&mdash;have you
thought about the bagman's story&mdash;the
first one? He says it is eighty years
since the events he relates took place,
and that would carry it back to 1747.
And yet the traveller damns his straps
and whiskers. Why, if he'd worn
strapped trousers and whiskers in those
days he'd have had a mob after him."</p>

<p>"Yes, and he wouldn't have been
driving a gig on Marlborough downs.
He'd have been riding with pistols in
his holsters, wrapped in a horseman's
cloak and wearing a plain bobwig.
I've thought of that too."</p>

<p>"I see you have. But there's
another&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Let me. Can you account for this?
<i>Martin Chuzzlewit</i> left <i>Mr. Pecksniff's</i>
house in the late autumn&mdash;say the last
of November to be on the safe side.
He stays five weeks in London and
then goes to America&mdash;say another five
weeks. Then, after a week in <i>Major
Pawkins</i>' boarding-house, he goes to a
place which is identified as the original
site of Cairo, Illinois&mdash;say another
week. This would land him there at
the end of February, when everything
is frozen stiff. But they travelled down
the river in a heat that blistered everything
it touched."</p>

<p>"No," I said jealously, "I have not
thought of that. Wonderful, isn't it,
how one likes to catch <span class="sc">Dickens</span> in a
mistake? Like having a joke on a
good old friend."</p>

<p>"Exactly," he said ardently, "I wish

<h3>AN UNLIKELY STORY</h3>.

<p>I am hoping very much that this
story will, as Agony Column advertisements
put it, meet the eye of a certain
Professor at a certain Academy of Music.
Of course I might tell it to him myself,
as he happens to be my Professor, at
least from 7 to 7.45 on Friday evenings;
but it is a story which involves a
great deal of explanation and, well&mdash;things
on the whole get believed better
in print.</p>

<p>To be quite frank I did begin telling
him at the time, but I saw that the
first two words had destroyed his faith
in the rest of it. I don't really blame
him, for it began with "my cleaner,"
and I don't suppose that he has the
ghost of an idea that, if you teach
cooking, as I do, under the London
County Council, they kindly keep a
charlady to wash up for you and so on,
and they call her a "cleaner."</p>

<p>The Professor is a very bad listener.
I might have managed to explain to
him what a cleaner is, but I never could
have made him see why she was having
tea with me, so I gave it up.</p>

<p>Really it is so simple. She lives at
Cambridge Heath; I live at Croydon,
which doesn't sound as countrified
but is really so much nicer that no
Croydon people who knew Cambridge
Heathers could help asking them to
tea at least once a year, when the
garden was at its best. My cleaner's
visit is always very delightful, because
she makes the garden seem at least
four times its usual size by sheer admiration;
but this year, just as she
was getting into her stride, it began to
rain, and we had to seek refuge by the
piano.</p>

<p>We sang "Where the Bee Sucks"
and "Annie Laurie" very successfully,
and she at last unthawed to the extent
of remarking that she would give us a
"chune," though she "hadn't stood up"
to sing by herself "for donkey's ears."
Stipulating that someone should help
her out if the need arose, she investigated
the inside of the piano-stool where
the music lives, looking for a suitable
song, and made, to her horror, the discovery
that among all the odd pages it
contained there was not one that had
ever adhered to a piece called "The
Maxeema," nor yet to a song which
asks how someone is "Goin' to keep
'em down on the farm now they've
seen gay Paree?"</p>

<p>The painful incident was passed over
at the time, "The Long Trail" being
discovered at the bottom of the pile
and satisfactorily negotiated, and I
forgot all about it until the next Friday
evening, when, just as I was about to
shake the dust of Cambridge Heath off
my shoes, my cleaner, rising from her
scrubbing, wiped her hands on her
apron, produced two large limp sheets
of white paper which resolved themselves
into the music I ought to have
had and hadn't, and pressed them upon
me with all the eagerness of a more
than cheerful giver.</p>

<p>A kind of panic seized me, for on
Friday evenings I make the Academy of
Music as it were a half-way house on
my way home. Under the cleaner's
kind and beaming glance there was
nothing to do but put them into the
attaché case in which I carry my music
and try to believe that, wonderful man
as he is, even my Professor wouldn't
be able to see inside it when it was
shut, in fact that it only rested with
me to be quite sure that in his presence
I only took out Chopin and not the
gentleman who was interested in farming.</p>

<p>And I managed nicely. I took out
the "Nocturnes" and shut the case up
again before the cleverest (and nicest)
of Professors could have guessed the
company they were keeping, and he
was graciously pleased to nod, instead
of shaking his head, for most of the
three-quarters of an hour. He really
must have been pleased with me, for
at 7.45 he told me that I showed
marked improvement, and then kept
me till 7.49 while he explained that a
<i>flair</i> for the best of music such as I exhibited
was both uncommon and, from
a Professor's point of view, exceeding
enjoyable. At 7.50&mdash;he, benign, I
blushful&mdash;we approached the attaché-case.</p>

<p>"Allow me," said my Professor,
reaching for it to replace Chopin; but
I snatched it up before he could get it.
Like most truly great men he is a
little absent-minded, and he didn't seem
to notice anything, but just held out his
hand in farewell. But when my Professor
shakes hands it means more than
that; it means benediction, recognition,
salutation&mdash;lots of things; for it is
rumoured at the Academy that he never
bestows that honour on any save those
whom he regards as kindred spirits,
acolytes at the altar of Music, personalities,
not pupils.</p>

<p>And then my attaché-case opened
itself quietly, after the manner of
attaché-cases, and laid "'Ow're you
goin' to keep 'em?" and "The Maxeema"
right side up, and their names in such
large print too, like an offering at his
wonderful feet. Trembling at the knees
I said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"My cleaner gave them to me."</p>

<p>But he looked at me and went on
looking, and that is why I hope so very
much that he will read this very unlikely
story.</p>

<h3>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h3>

<h4>(<i>By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.</i>)</h4>

<p>A new novel by <span class="sc">Anthony Hope</span> certainly deserves in
these days to be considered a literary event of some importance.
His <i>Lucinda</i> (<span class="sc">Hutchinson</span>) seems to me both
in plot and treatment equal to the best of his work; as
dignified and yet as lightly handled as anything he has
given us in the past. The plot (which I must not betray)
is excellent. From the moment when <i>Julius</i>, the narrator,
making his leisurely way to the wedding of <i>Lucinda</i>, is
passed by her alone in a taxicab going in an opposite
direction, the interest of the intrigue never slackens. Into
an epoch of rather "over-ripe" and messy fiction this
essentially clean and well-ordered tale comes with an effect
very refreshing and tonic. <span class="sc">Anthony Hope's</span> characters
as ever are vigorously alive; in <i>Lucinda</i> herself he has
drawn a heroine as charming as any in that long gallery
that now stretches between her and the immortal <i>Dolly</i>.
In short, those novel-readers who are (shall I say?) beginning
to demand the respect due to middle age will enjoy in
these pages the threefold reward of present interest, retrospection
and a comforting sense that the literary judgment
of their generation is here triumphantly vindicated in the
eyes of unbelieving youth. What could be more pleasant?</p>

<hr />

<p>It is a delight to welcome the <i>Life of Mrs. R. L.
Stevenson</i> (<span class="sc">Chatto and Windus</span>), not only for the exceptional
attraction of the environment in which she lived
for many years, but because under any circumstances she
would have been a remarkable woman. Once, when asked
to write her own life, she refused because it seemed to her
like "a dazed rush on a railroad express;" she despaired
of recovering "the incidental memories." So it fell to her
sister, Mrs. <span class="sc">Van De Grift Sanchez</span>, to undertake the task.
A difficult one, for there was always the fear that the personality
of Mrs. <span class="sc">Stevenson</span> might seem to be overshadowed
by that of her husband. But the author, in giving us many
interesting details about <span class="sc">Robert Louis Stevenson</span>, has been
careful to select for the most part only those in which his
wife was closely concerned. "In my sister's character,"
she writes, "there were many strange contradictions, and
I think sometimes this was a part of her attraction, for
even after knowing her for years one could always count
on some surprise, some unexpected contrast which went far
in making up her fascinating personality." Contradictions
undoubtedly were to be found in her; thus during her
later years Mrs. <span class="sc">Stevenson</span> intensely desired quietness and
peace, and yet her love for change of scene never seemed
to abate; but she was constant in her devotion as a wife and
in her staunchness as a friend. Some excellent illustrations
are included in this volume, and the only fault I have to
find with it is that it lacks an index.</p>

<hr />

<p>In selecting his hero for <i>No Defence</i> (<span class="sc">Hodder and
Stoughton</span>) from the mutineers at the Nore, it may be
admitted that Sir <span class="sc">Gilbert Parker</span> displayed a certain
originality. With regard, to the <i>clou</i> of his plot, however,
I can hardly say so much. Melodramatic young lovers
have (in fiction) gone to prison and worse rather than
employ a defence involving distress to the ladies of their
choice, from ages untold. <i>Dyck Calhoon</i> did it when he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="page440" id="page440"></a>[pg 440]</span>
wrongly indicted for the killing of <i>Erris Boyne</i>, who was a
traitor in the pay of France and incidentally the father of
the heroine <i>Sheila</i>; though she knew nothing of this and
would have been badly worried if the hazards of a defended
murder case had brought it to light. Do you call the
motive sufficient? No more do I. However, <i>Dyck</i> goes
to prison, emerging just in time to join the fleet and
became a successful rebel under the Naval soviets established
by <span class="sc">Richard Parker</span>. Subsequently he takes his
ship into action on the legitimate side, earns the quasi-pardon
of exile on parole in Jamaica, finds a fortune of
Spanish treasure, quells a black rising, is cleared of the
murder charge (by the wholly preposterous arrival in the
island of the now aged lady who had really done the deed&mdash;exactly
like the <i>finale</i> of a <span class="sc">Gilbert</span> and Sullivan opera)
and marries the heroine. A breathless plot, by which,
however, my own pulse remained
unquickened. To
be brutally frank, indeed,
the telling seemed to me
wholly lacking in precisely
the qualities of dash and
crescendo required to carry
off such a tale. Costume romance
that halts and looks
backward soon loses my
following.</p>

<hr />

<p>Airedales and collies, according
to Lieut.-Colonel <span class="sc">E. H.
Richardson</span>, are notable
for a truly remarkable and
admirable characteristic.
They would honestly rather
be at work than just playing
round. All the same, no one
guessed before the War what
they, and many other kinds
of dogs, were able and willing
to do for their country
in emergency on guard and
sentry duty, and, most of all,
as battle-field messengers.
Moreover it took the genius
of the man who of all the
world knows most of their
mind to discover it. His
book, <i>British War Dogs</i>
(<span class="sc">Skeffington</span>), is neither very brilliantly written nor
particularly well arranged (it contains quite a lot of repetitions and
a system of punctuation all its own), but it is of more than
average interest. The author details the training of war-dogs&mdash;literally
"all done by kindness"&mdash;and records many thrilling
exploits and heroisms of his friends. Further, he states
at some length some rather attractive views on dog metaphysics,
of which one need say no more than that, if you
wish to believe that your four-footed pal has a soul to be
saved as well as a body to be patted, here is high authority
to support you. I think what one misses all through these
pages is the dog's own story. Without it one never seems
to get quite to grips with the subject. What were <i>Major's</i>
thoughts and feelings, for instance, when carrying a message
twelve miles in an hour over all obstacles, dodging the shells
as he ran? Not even Colonel <span class="sc">Richardson</span> can find a way
to get a personal interview out of him.</p>

<hr />

<p>All the Scandinavian countries have in the last twenty-five
years produced novel-writers of power and distinction,
but with the single exception of the Swedish authoress,
<span class="sc">Selma Lagerlöf</span>, whose great novel, <i>Gosta Berling</i>, was
awarded the Nobel Prize, and the Norwegian, <span class="sc">Knut
Hamsun</span>, whose extremely unpleasant book, <i>Hunger</i>, was
published in this country a score of years ago, few if any of
them have been made accessible to the average English
reader. Now the Gyldendal Publishing Company of Copenhagen
has undertaken the neglected task of producing
English translations of the best Scandinavian fiction, the
latest of which is <i>Guest the One-Eyed</i>, by the Icelandic
novelist, <span class="sc">Gunnar Gunnarsson</span>. It is not a particularly
powerful narrative, and is marked by the characteristic
inconsequence that tends to convert the Scandinavian novel
into a mélange of family biographies; yet the author has
been successful in weaving into his chapters some of the
beauty and magic of his native land, lovely and forbidding
by turns, and the charm and simplicity of its people. So
when he makes <i>Ormarr
Orlygsson</i> fling away the
strenuous work of ten years
and a promising career as a
great violinist to return to
a pastoral life on his father's
Iceland estates, the step
seems neither strange nor
unnatural. So with the perfectly
villainous <i>Sera Ketill</i>,
who at the culmination of
unparalleled infamies suddenly
repents and becomes
the far-wandering and well-beloved
<i>Guest</i>, we do not
feel anything strained in the
author's assumption that in
Iceland, at any rate, such
things easily happen. <i>Guest
the One-Eyed</i> is not a noteworthy
novel in the sense
that <i>Gosta Berling</i> was.
Yet one would not have
missed reading it.</p>

<hr />

<p>It is interesting to watch
heredity at play. Given
the inclination to write,
what kind of a first book
should we get from the son
of one of the most cultured
and sensitive classical
scholars and translators of this or any day and from
the grandson of the painter of the Legend of the Briar Rose?
The question is answered by Mr. <span class="sc">Denis Mackail's</span> <i>What
Next?</i> (<span class="sc">John Murray</span>), which on examination turns out to
be a farcical novel. The story has certain technical weaknesses,
but these are forgotten in the excitements of the
chase, for the main theme is the tracking down of a coarse
capitalist who defrauded the hero of his fortune and did
something very low against England. With the assistance
of a new character in fiction, a super-valet, justice is done
and we are all (except the coarse capitalist and his son)
extremely happy. Mr. <span class="sc">Mackail</span> has invented some excellent
scenes and he carries them off with gaiety and spirit. In his
second book (and for the answer to <i>What Next?</i> we shall
not, I imagine, have long to wait) he will amend certain
little faults, not the least of which is a tendency to give us
the most significant events in the form of retrospective narrative
instead of letting us see them as they occur.</p>

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
